Overview
The given webpage displays a canvas with gray background and brown ground. In this lab, you will write the necessary JavaScript to create the snowman scene shown below.

300 x 300 image with white snowman with three circles appears on brown ground with blue "SNOW" behind it and many small diamond snowflakes scattered randomly about.



Step 1: Inspect the project
The index.html file contains a single 300 x 300 canvas. 

The snowman.js file contains three completed functions:

The DOMContentLoaded event handler calls drawGround(), drawSnowText(), drawSnowman(), and drawSnowflakes() to create the snowman scene.

drawGround() displays brown ground under a light gray sky.

drawSnowflakes() calls drawSingleFlake() 100 times to display 100 snow flakes in randomly chosen locations.

Step 2: Implement drawSnowText()
The drawSnowText() function should display the string "SNOW" using:

font: 80px Verdana
textAlign: center
textBaseline: top
fillStyle: blue
fillText()to display the text at coordinate (canvas.width / 2, 10)
Step 3: Implement drawSnowman()
The drawSnowman() function should display three white circles:

Bottom circle: arc() centered at (150, 200) with radius 50 that begins at 0 and ends at Math.PI * 2
Middle circle: arc() centered at (150, 120) with radius 40 that begins at 0 and ends at Math.PI * 2
Top circle: arc() centered at (150, 60) with radius 25 that begins at 0 and ends at Math.PI * 2
All three circles should use fillStyle white and be displayed with the fill() function
Step 4: Implement drawSingleFlake()
The drawSingleFlake() function should display a single white snowflake in the shape of a diamond using the constant flakeSize:

Start a new path
Move to the coordinate (x, y)
Draw a line to (x + flakeSize / 2, y + flakeSize / 2), then to (x, y + flakeSize), and then to (x - flakeSize / 2, y + flakeSize / 2)
Use the fillStyle #eee
Use fill() to display the diamond
Submit your solution when the JavaScript functions successfully render the snowman scene. For the automated testing to work correctly, the context properties and functions above must be set or called in the order specified.
